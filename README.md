# About-Me
# 👋 Hey, welcome to my space!

I enjoy mixing creativity with technical problem-solving. Most of the time, you’ll find me working with **Excel** (yes, I actually love formulas, dashboards, Power Query, and Pivot Tables 😅).

I also dive into **MySQL** to organize, clean, and explore data, and when needed, I troubleshoot **hardware** and handle **software installations**—because sometimes the challenge isn’t just in the data, but in the machine running it!

What I really enjoy is taking messy data or tricky tasks and turning them into something clear, useful, and even a little fun. I like to balance **organization, communication, and analytical thinking** with a good dose of creativity.
